# Event Scheduler

## Overview
This MVP will include the ability to create a new Event with several types (Appointment, Meeting, Reminder, Task), update an Event with new details, and remove Events if no longer needed. In addition to those features, this MVP should be a full-stack application featuring a User Interface, an Application Programming Interface, and a Database, we recommend using React, Express, and MongoDB, respectively. It should also be hosted on Heroku.
